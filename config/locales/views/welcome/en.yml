      description: "&emsp;<strong>The Resume Maker</strong> is an ideal platform for IT professionals to build job-worthy 
                    resumes as quickly as possible in a simple process. The Resume Maker is designed for IT professionals 
                    so that an IT job-seeker can create strong, job-worthy resumes at no cost.  It was developed by <em>Akshay</em>,
                    an IT Professional, with the help of his best friend, <em>PaulJoe</em>, also an IT professional. "
      story: "&emsp;The idea of the Resume Maker came when <em>Akshay</em> started seeking a new job. During his job search process, 
             he decided to create a resume. With that intention, <em>Akshay</em>  started searching for online resume templates.
             Unfortunately, none of the templates were up to his satisfaction. Also, in the case of online resume templates,
             they're not free to download. We have to pay money for templates that are not up to our satisfaction. <em>Akshay</em> 
             discussed his situation and thoughts with <em>PaulJoe</em>, an IT enthusiast,  and <em>PaulJoe</em> challenged  
             <em>Akshay</em> to create his own <strong>Resume Maker</strong> tool. The mind set behind the challenge is that 
             the manpower behind the online resume templates are IT professionals, and we (<em>Akshay</em> and <em>PaulJoe</em>)
             are also IT Professionals. As an IT professional, it's not good to depend on other IT professionals for things that
             we can do if we have a mind to do. With all the inspiration from other great engineers in this world, <em>Akshay</em>
             started developing his own <strong>Resume Maker</strong> with the most valuable review done by his best friend, <em>PaulJoe</em>."
