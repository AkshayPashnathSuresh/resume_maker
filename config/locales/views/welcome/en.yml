      description: "&emsp;<strong>Resume Maker</strong> is an ideal platform for IT Professionals to build job-worthy 
                    resumes as fast as possible in a simple process. Resume Maker is designed for IT Professionals so that an IT Job-seeker can create strong
                    job-worthy resumes with no cost. It is developed by <em>Akshay</em> an IT Professional
                    with the help of his best friend <em>PaulJoe</em> an IT Professional. "
      story: "&emsp;The Idea of Resume Maker came when <em>Akshay</em> started seeking new job. During his Job seeking process,
             he decided to create a resume. With that intention, <em>Akshay</em> started searching online resume templates.
             Unfortunately none of the templates were up to his satisfaction. Also In the case of online resume templates, 
             it's not free to hand, we have to pay money for templates which are not up to our satisfaction. <em>Akshay</em> 
             discusssed his situation and thoughts to <em>PaulJoe</em> an IT enthusiastic and <em>PaulJoe</em> challenged 
             <em>Akshay</em> to create his own <strong>Resume Maker</strong> tool. The mind set behind the challenging is that,
             the man-power behind the online resume templates are IT Professionals and we (<em>Akshay</em> and <em>PaulJoe</em>)
             are also IT Professionals. As an IT Professional, it's not Good to depend on other IT professionals for things that 
             we can do, if we have a mind to do. With all inspirations from other Great Engineers in this world, <em>Akshay</em>
             started developing his own <strong>Resume Maker</strong> with the most valuable reviewing done by his best friend <em>PaulJoe</em>."
